# Basic Set-Up 

## Getting Github set up

First, install the newest version of [Git](https://git-scm.com/download) for your device
Once you have Git installed, open a terminal 

Go to Github and sign in/register your account - keep this browser open because you'll need to sign in again

### Fork this repo

Follow the steps listed in [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github-3/) guide, and set up your own local branch of the project. 

It's important to keep your own work confined to your own branch, and then merge changes to the master later
Do **not** force push anything

Github isn't an auto sync software (at least not with the IDEs we're using), you need to be constantly *push*ing your new code into the shared repo, and *pull*ing the code other people worked on to stay up to date. 
If we all work out of the master branch, this will inevitibly lead to errors - stay in your own branch until it's the proper time to merge
